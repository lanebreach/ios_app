# ios_app
The Lane Breach iOS app allows users to report bicycle lane blockages to San Francisco's 311 service. 

The existing 311 mobile app already offers this functionality, but it's clunky and not intuitive. 
This app offers a streamlined experience and also provides users with a visualization of bike infrastructure
and lane blockages reported by all users city-wide, as well as a summary of all incidents reported by the current user.

## Getting Started
To build this app, you'll need a Mac with a recent-ish version of OS X and Xcode (the original version of this app was 
developed with Xcode 10.1 running on OS X High Sierra). This app is written in Swift 4.
